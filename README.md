# Content to Quiz

The goal of this project is to allow a user to commit text in a number of formats (.txt, .srt, .html, etc.) in Japanese or English, and create a short quiz based on frequently occuring words in the text. This will allow foreign language teachers to give their students the freedom to select any content they desire and autogenerate a quiz based on that content.
